# JAMSTACK

- The reading content explains the concept and features of JAMstack, a web development architecture based on JavaScript, APIs, and Markup.
JAMstack allows developers to create fast, secure, and scalable websites by pre-rendering static pages and assets that can be served from a CDN.
- JAMstack is different from serverless, which is a cloud computing model that runs code without managing servers. JAMstack apps can use serverless APIs, but they are not always serverless.
- JAMstack apps are composed of three components: JavaScript for dynamic functionality, APIs for backend services, and Markup for pre-rendered HTML files. These files are served from a CDN or object storage, which improves performance and scalability.
- JAMstack apps have many benefits, such as faster loading, lower cost, higher security, and easier maintenance. They also follow the AWS Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of best practices for cloud infrastructure.
- JAMstack apps can be built with various tools and frameworks, such as Gatsby, Next.js, 11ty, Netlify, and Zeit. Some examples of JAMstack sites are freecodecamp.org, impossiblefoods.com, and web.dev.
