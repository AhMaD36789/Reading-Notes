# DB schema

its the blueprint for how the db is constructed.defining tables, datatypes and relationships.

schemas help with normalization processes to avoid data duplication

## DB keys

primary key: its the coloumn with a unique value that serves to uniquely identify the row

foreign key: its the coloumn that refers to the primary key of another table

composite key: its the compination of two coloumn or more that are used to uniquely identify a row

## relationships in a relational DB

mainly used for linking tables together. 3 types

ONE TO ONE: each row in one table is associated with only one row in another table

ONE TO MANY: each row in one table can be associated with multiple rows in another table

MANY TO MANY: multiple rows in one table can be associated with multiple rows in another table
