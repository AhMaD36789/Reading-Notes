# DTO

Data transfer between various layers or components of an application is done using DTOs, also known as Data Transfer Objects.

 By limiting the amount of data transferred over the network, concealing sensitive or irrelevant data, and decoupling the internal data model from the external data representation, they can aid in enhancing an application's performance, security, or maintainability.

 ASP. For each entity class you want to expose to clients, you can create a DTO class using NET Core 3.0. You can then customize the serialization and deserialization of the properties by using attributes like [JsonIgnore] or [SonPropertyName].

 Additionally, you must manually or automatically map the entity class to the DTO class using a library like AutoMapper. The DTO class can be used in controller methods to accept or return data from or to clients, with mapping methods used to convert between the entity class and the DTO class as needed.
