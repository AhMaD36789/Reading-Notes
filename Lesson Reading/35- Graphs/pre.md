# Graphs

- A graph is a collection of vertices and edges that can represent various types of data and relationships.
- Graphs can be classified into different types based on their properties, such as undirected, directed, acyclic, cyclic, complete, connected, and disconnected.
- Graphs can also have weights assigned to their edges to indicate the cost or value of the connection.
- Graphs can be represented using different data structures, such as adjacency matrices and adjacency lists.
- Graphs can be traversed using different algorithms, such as breadth-first and depth-first traversal.
- Graphs have many applications in various fields, such as computer science, social networks, transportation, and more.
