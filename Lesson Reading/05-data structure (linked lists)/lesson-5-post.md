# Data Structures

## how do we best define static

we have class called Console
Console is used to WriteLine among other things
Console is static class
we can use Console.WriteLine without creating an object of type Console
if it wasnt static we would need to create object of type Console to use WriteLine

We also have a static members in a non-static class (which is we can create instances from it)

value of static member in non static class is shared between all instances. its not unique to one instance

## Linked list

its a flexable dynamic size data structure efficient insertion and deletion

the space in the memory that contains a single element is called a node the reference to the second element is called pointer

## why use linked list

more efficient in terms of storage and data insertion/deletion
to avoid the contiguous memory consireaints of array

## what is linked list

collection of independant nodes
each node has a value and a pointer to another code

## how do we implement linked list

we will have: 2 classes

Class nodes
value
next
Class linked list
head

## linked list types

- singly linked list

- doubly linked list

- circular linked list
