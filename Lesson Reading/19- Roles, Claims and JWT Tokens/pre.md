# Claims-based authorization in ASP.NET Core

Claims-based authorization in ASP.NET Core empowers effective resource access control within web applications. This mechanism hinges on security claims, encapsulating identity, roles, and attributes in key-value pairs. User authentication generates claims, enriching the user's principal object. Subsequently, authorization checks user claims against resource requirements. ASP.NET Core offers policy-based authorization, customizing access criteria, accommodating diverse scenarios like role-based control, fine-grained access, and personalized attribute-based access.

## JWT Authentication

Similarly, JWT JSON Web Token authentication streamlines secure authentication data sharing. JWTs contain a header, payload, and signature. During user authentication, JWTs carry user-specific claims, facilitating subsequent server interaction. The process involves token issuance, client storage, token verification, and server authorization based on token claims. Stateless JWT authentication optimizes scalability in distributed systems, eliminating session data storage.

In conclusion, Claims-based authorization and JWT authentication significantly bolster web application security by orchestrating controlled access and trustworthy identity validation. These methodologies ensure robust user interactions within a secure digital ecosystem.
