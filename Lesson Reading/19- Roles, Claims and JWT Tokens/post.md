# JSON Web Tokens

 (JWTs) are used to authenticate and authorize users. JWTs are digitally signed tokens that contain a set of claims, which are statements about the user. These claims can include information such as the user’s identity, roles, and permissions.

## Roles

are used to group users based on their level of access or responsibility within an application. For example, an application might have roles such as “Admin”, “Editor”, and “User”. Users can be assigned to one or more roles, and these roles can be used to determine what actions a user is allowed to perform within the application.

## Claims

 are pieces of information about the user that are included in the JWT. Claims can be used to store information such as the user’s name, email address, and roles. Claims can also be used to store custom information about the user that is specific to the application
