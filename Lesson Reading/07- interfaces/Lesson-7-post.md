# interfaces

today we learnt about interfaces and how its implemented instead of using abstract since its using the same properties and methods with different implementations.

we talked about the ability of inheriting multiple interfaces unlike class inheritance where i can only implement one inheritance

for example implementing a drive method in an interface means that i want to implement multiple driving methods in multiple classes but the actual requirements for the drive method is different from class to class.

we also talked about the syntax of implementing interfaces which is very similar to overriding methods in abstract and virtual methods
