# MVC

is a design pattern or architecture that helps in developing web applications in a more efficient way when compared with traditional ASP.NET Web Applications. It separates the application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller. Each of these components is built to handle different aspects of the application.

## Tag Helpers

in ASP.NET Core enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files. They target HTML elements based on element name, attribute name, or parent tag. Tag Helpers provide an HTML-friendly development experience, a rich IntelliSense environment for creating HTML and Razor markup, and a way to make you more productive and able to produce more robust, reliable, and maintainable code using information only available on the server.

Some key points about MVC and Tag Helpers are:

1. MVC makes the design of the application into three layers: Model, View, and Controller.
1. Tag Helpers reduce the explicit transitions between HTML and C# in Razor views.
1. MVC enhances test-driven development by making the UI and action logic loosely coupled.
1. Tag Helpers provide an HTML-friendly development experience.
1. MVC is action-based architecture. Based on the action, an appropriate View is displayed.
1. Tag Helpers enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files.
