# 2nd Lesson Post

The second lecture introduced us to a new method of testing code using xUnit and how to setup test cases.

it also introduced us to keywords while working in the xUnit such as [fact] and [theory] and how do we work with them

I should that this way of code testing is very reasonable and useful for bigger programs and it keeps me from testing my code manually everytime

also on how to work with it im still experimenting but i feel that finishing a function then going to the test project and creating a function is more effecient that finishing the entire code then implementing tests

im yet to utalize the [theory] but i saw since this was a very basic program i should use the basic [fact] to test my entire program in following labs i will use [theory]
