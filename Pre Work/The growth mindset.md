# Points to keep in mind when thinking about Growth Mindset

- Utalize deliprate practice

    practice in the areas that you are most challenged in. dont practice building entire application. this will push you outside your comfort zone. note that deliberate practice is highly demanding mentally, difficult and requires good goals.

- all programmers are self taught, meaning you are the best to judge the areas in which you need improvement in?

- In technical problems. there are two levels, the fist is 'does your code achieve the required output?' which is answered with a simple yes or no. The second level is 'how easy is it to understand your code ?', 'how ( organized / secure ) is your code ?'

## what is grit and why is one the most important things to help your growth mindset

- grit is passion and perseverance for very long, grit is having stamina, grit is sticking with your future day in day out not just for week or month but years and working really hard to make that future a reality. grit is living life like a marathon not a sprint.

- the most shocking thing about grit is how little research we have on it, and how little science knows about building it.

- talent doesnt make you gritty. the growth mindset is the best way to build grit

## EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE SELF-ASSESSMENT

My strengths are self-awareness, self-management, and social awareness, which help me to identify and control my emotions effectively. However, I need to work on my relationship management skills, as I sometimes struggle to interact and cooperate with others. I will be seeking guidance on the topic of relationship management and looking at ways to improve. this has always been a cause of trouble for me due to life circumstances and im aware of it being an issue

## Bias Self-Assessment

The bias self-assessment test showed me that I have a lot to work on in some areas of unconscious bias. I did well on understanding what bias is and how it affects the brain, but I did poorly on connecting with people who are not like me. I didn't learn or see any need for change because the type of divercity and inclusivity is referring to the type of people that would demand I get fired for not calling preferred pronouns or other strokes of madness. I refuse to be a part of such a community even if it causes me to not have a job.

accepting women is the diversity and inclusivity thats currently being advocated for in our society but thats a different topic with a different answer. the short and sweet version is i dont mind women being in the work enviroment so long as there are set boundries and guarentees for her rights and understanding that if she didnt need to work she wouldnt be here as its the man responsability to provide.
