### **The 5 whys technique**

this technique is used to identify the root of the issue and to prevent it from reoccurring 

### when do we use it

it can be used for troubleshooting, quality improvement and problem solving but its best usecase is to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems

### how to use it

1. assemble a team

2. define the problem

3. ask the first "Why?"

4. ask "Why?" four more times

## How to think like a programmer

### **why is this important**

Problem solving is a meta skill. here is the best way to solve a problem a) have a framework b) practice it. alright lets dive in

### So, what should you do when you encounter a new problem?

1. Understand: know exactly what is being asked. How to know when you understand a problem? When you can explain it in plain English.

2. Plan: Nothing can help you if you can't write the exact steps AKA have your plan ready before executing. To write a good plan answer this question:"Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?"

3. Divide: break your problem into sub-problems. these sub-problems are much easier to solve. Then solve each sub-problem ibe by ibe. begin with the simplest. Once all subs are done connect the dots.

4. Stuck ?

- Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong.

- Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?

- Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem!

Caveat: Don’t look for a solution to the big problem. Only look for solutions to sub-problems. Why? Because unless you struggle (even a little bit), you won’t learn anything. If you don’t learn anything, you wasted your time.

5. Practice: Don’t expect to be great after just one week. If you want to be a good problem-solver, solve a lot of problems!

Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that “this problem could easily be solved with <insert concept here>.”

## How to solve programming problems

The most common mistake I see is trying to start writing code as soon as possible.

### **A simple set of steps**

1. Read the problem completely twice. This is the single most important step. You may even want to read the problem 3 or 4 times.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data. Solve the problem with at least three different inputs to make sure you really understand your solution and that it will work for more than one case.

3. Optimize the manual steps. What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify.

4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code. What we want to do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.

5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code. This step should be extremely easy at this point. If you have done all the other steps, this step involves no problem solving at all. All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code

6. Optimize the real code. Sometimes this step isn’t necessary, but it’s worth taking a look at your code and figuring out if you can cut out a few lines or do something simpler.

### A final tip

Many times you will find that a problem itself involves multiple large steps or is very complicated.  In those instances, you will want to try and find a way to cut the problem directly in half and then following the process above for each half.

This method of tackling a problem is called “divide and conquer” and is quite effective.  A good way to know where to break a problem in half is to think about what part of the problem if already given to you would make solving the rest easy.

### Discussion Questions

What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

Looking at the market status and how competitive it is, and the level of readiness being displayed by applicants I think a better form of this question would be you telling me what do you need from an employee to be capable of and discuss if Im able to excel while having these traits?

What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

trace the problem with words -> divide & conquer -> 5 minute break to be able to establish a different perspective.
